To configure customized cortana commands, 
I'm going to use visual studio community 
edition 2015. 

Search for the universal windows application template. 
If you don't have it installed, there will be a 
button to install it and then you can continue. 

You'll also need to enable developer mode. You'll
see I get this popup, so go to start and search
settings for developers and enable developer mode.

After the project loads, let's add an XML file.
The XML file is where we'll define our Voice Command
Definitions, or VCDs. This is where we specify what
cortana will listen to.
